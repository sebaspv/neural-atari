## Neural Atari
### A Monorepo of my re-learning journey of reinforcement learning algorithms, custom policies, and more! <br></br>
</div>


I created this monorepo to share some of the exercises I made to re-learn reinforcement learning, from basic pre-made policies to custom policies, neural nets, and environments. All of these examples are in their respective directory numbered in the order I coded them in the `src` directory.

All of these examples use `pytorch` for the policies and `stable-baselines3` for the environments with `gym`. You can install all of the requirements for this monorepo with Pipenv using the `Pipfile` file.
